# Animations [![Actions Status](https://github.com/mikelrob/Animations/workflows/Swift/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mikelrob/Animations/actions)

Animations provide a small number of wrappers around UIKit that I think are nice to have when writing animation code.

`Animation` is a wrapper around `UIView.animate`  that provides an interface to chain animations.

The `AnimationCoordinator` provides a interface to coordinate multiple `UIViewPropertyAnimator`s alongside each other.
